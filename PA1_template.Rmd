## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
1)Load the data
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv",header = TRUE, sep=',')

2)Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
activity$date<-ymd(activity$date)
str(activity)
head(activity)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
1)Calculate the total number of steps per day and group by date:
steps_day<- activity %>%
    filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarize(dly_steps = sum(steps)) %>%
    
2)Using ggplot for making hystogram    
graph1<-ggplot(steps_day,aes(x=dly_steps))+geom_histogram( boundary=0,col="darkblue",fill="darkgreen",binwidth = 1200) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,25000,2500))+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,26,2))
 
3)Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:
mean_steps <- mean(steps_day$dly_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps <- median(steps_day$dly_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
